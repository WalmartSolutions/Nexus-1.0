# Why?

Stephen should learn to not trust random mfs that main Masterof13fps (Gays only platform LMAO). </br>
The dev also claims he used ZKM to obf but I don't believe a word he said.

# How To Use
1. Download the Fabric installer from [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/), open it and choose Minecraft 1.21 & Fabric Loader 0.15.X
2. Download Nexus-1.0.jar from this repository along with [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/version/0.100.1+1.21) page and put it into your .minecraft/mods folder
3. Start the game (with Fabric)
